# Installation instructions
Inside the root folder, run
`npm install`

After the modules are installed correctly, execute the following:
`npm run dev`

And it's done! The application is running.

# About the project
I bootstraped the project using Vite, the folder structure for this project is as follows:
titanic-data/   
├── 📁 src/                  # Source code  
│   ├── 📁 components/       # Reusable UI components  
│   ├── 📁 context/          # React Context providers  
│   ├── 📁 data/             # Data layer (types and the actual data)  
│   ├── 📄 App.tsx           # Main application component  
│   └── 📄 main.tsx          # Entry point for the application  

I used Context API for state management and styled-components for styling.
